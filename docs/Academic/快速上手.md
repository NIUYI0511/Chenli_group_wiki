# Get up to speed (for beginners)

For beginners (first and second year bachelor students), there are a bunch of technical skill needed to be able to collaborate with others professionally. Here are recommened resources to get everyone up to speed and have basic technical skills. Learning these are investments to improve efficiency in real-world work.

## Academic skills

- How to search for research papers? People are talking about papers! Where are they getting them from?
  - Ways of obtaining some research papers.
    - Get it from colleagues. Surprisingly, you will get papers from your colleagues more than you thought. Once people know what you are doing and they stump across relevant (and often interesting) papers, they will kindly forward them to you. People who are more exprienced are more likely to get better papers. So, keep an eye out for that. 
    - Tracing back from references. Once you have a seed paper. Looking at both sides which are referencing papers and papers that cite that particular paper is a way to look for more papers.
      - Referencing papers are easy to find since everything is always listed at the end of the paper in the reference section. 
      - Finding papers that cite the paper is more tricky since it is impossible to keep looking for all new papers that may cite that paper. Luckily, there are services like Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, and Web of Science which can do the tracking for you. 
    - Look at the journal or conferences. Papers from the same journal or conferences tend to have more relavancy toward each other. Series of papers in the same topic are often published in the same journal. 
    - Search using scientific paper search tools.
      - Google Scholar: automatic indexing (anything that could be considered as a scientific article will be indexed automatically, so keep in mind that not everything on Google Scholar is credible.)
      - Semantic Scholar (https://www.semanticscholar.org/)
      - Baidu Scholar
      - PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/): Articles in the field of medicine. Only credible sources are indexed here. 
      - Web of Science (https://webofknowledge.com): This is a paid service (often bought by universities) to search for papers. It has tools to help you filter out unwanted papers, leaving only the ones that matter to your search. 
      - Scopus
    - Use paper recommender system. There are many recommender systems. (March's opinion: It does not work for me very well) 
    - Subscribe to newsletters. Recommendation: Nature Briefing, Science, IEEE Spectrum, deeplearning.ai, JAMA, PLOS ONE
    - Papers directed from project website. 
  - Should I read this paper?
    - Don't read every paper that came your way. Otherwise, you will never have time for everything else, let alone finishing reading them all. 
    - Survey first (do some search on how to survey the paper), then decide which paper to read. Looking at the source of the paper.
      - Did they came from influential journal? Look at the impact factor (although IF does not reflect everything). Look at IF using SJR (https://www.scimagojr.com/journalrank.php) or Journal Citation Reports (https://jcr.clarivate.com/).
      - Were they presented in a good conferences. 
      - We have a list of journals that people in the lab read. Please check that out. 
  - What is SCI indexing? A simple Wikipedia page would answer that for you: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Citation_Index
  - Summary on scientific papers. Judgments on papers should be derived from source of the paper. Who wrote them? How were they published? What is the reviewing process? Who get indexed in SCI? And so on. After all, credibility does not equal the quality of each particular work.
- Example research papers:
  - Head and Neck Injuries Associated With Cell Phone Use, JAMA - This is easy to read because it does not have a lot of unnecessary technical terms.


## Technical skills and concepts

- Version control system: git
  - This one is more conventional: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/git/index.htm
  - This one is a bit nicer, but you need to know that BitBucket is not git!: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials

- Regular expression (regex/re)
  - Super simple, useful, and quick tutorial: https://regexone.com

## On OpenHI project

- Choose to read one of the origianl OpenHI paper (they are almost the same)
  - Read OpenHI BIBM2018 Paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8621393 (try to access this link with and without campus network) 
  - OpenHI IJDMB 2019 Paper:[proof.pdf](https://github.com/NIUYI0511/Chenli_group_wiki/blob/main/docs/Group_Issue_Management/files/openhi-ijdmb-proof.pdf)

- Get to know libMI:
