# Data sharing repositories to enhance reserach reproducibility

## What is reproducible research

**Research reproducibility** has been a problem since the beginning of reserach itself. Scienctists lay some groud rules to **make sure that their experiments can be repeated** thus resulting in many strict experiment parameters. In computer science, sharing source code or making a project open source may relive some parts of the problem since other researchers could run the code and produce the same or similar results. However, in the age of big data and deep learning algorithms, the data used to train the model is also needed in order to repeat the experiment. These datasets are often large and hard to explore (because of various formats and the size) therefore hard to share. Below are projects and initiatives to facilitate open data and open science! Other concepts are also being used to promote reproducible research: 

- open-access journals
- open source project
  - Licensing: MIT, GPL, CC

## Data hosting services

### Zenodo

Kaggle is a data science competition platform and online community for data scientists and machine learning practitioners under Google LLC. Kaggle enables users to find and publish datasets, explore and build models in a web-based data science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.

GigaDB is a data repository supporting scientific publications in the Life/Biomedical Sciences domain. GigaDB organises and curates data from individually publishable units into datasets, which are provided openly and in as FAIR manner as possible for the global research community. Originally GigaDB primarily served as a repository to host data and tools associated with articles in GigaScience; however, it is now accepting datasets that are not associated with GigaScience articles
